## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
myData_TEMPO <- read.csv("~/poly_online/results/myData_TEMPO.csv")

# Subset Chosen meter only
cmTEMPO<-myData_TEMPO[c(1, 422:439)]
cmPITCH <-myData_PITCH[402:429]

barplot(table(cm[ChosenMeter_T.2.3.40.60:ChosenMeter_T.2.3.3037.4556],),main="Chosen Meter",names.arg=c("1","2","3","4","5","5","7","8"),ylim=c(0,dim(cm)[1]))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
